# ComputingMethods2022
## In this repository, You can find a C++ implementation of several Computing Methods completed as assignments during my university studies. It includes:
- Lagrange Polynomial interpolation
- Newton Polynomial interpolation
- Gaussian elimination
- Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting
- Gauss-Crout elimination
- Jacobi iteration method
- Numerical integration (rectangle rule, trapezoid rule, Simpson rule)
- Numerical integration with the Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule
- Approximation
- Gram's orthogonal polynomial approximation for equidistant nodes
- Gram's orthogonal polynomial approximation for non-distant nodes
- Numerical procedures for solving ordinary differential equations (Euler algorithm, Runge-Kutta of 4th order algorithm, Runge-Kutta of 4th order algorithm)
- Root-finding algorithms (Newtonâ€“Raphson method, Secant method, Bisection method, Regula falsi)
